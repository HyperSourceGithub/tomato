# >>> project tomato
## >>> a simple, python-based game about tomatoes.
###### i dont know why i made this lol

this is my goofiest project yet lol <br/>
also this might actually turn into an entire, full-fledged and supported game
why does github not let me publish releases under the same tag :(

#### rules: 
1. all commits must start with "tomato"
2. tomato.
3. tomato.
4. tomato.
5. tomato sauce?
